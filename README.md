# NM_AI_BUILDING_A_SMARTER_AI-POWERED_SPAM_CLASSIFIER
AI-Powered Spam Classifier

Project Overview:
This project is an AI-powered spam classifier that uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify messages as spam or non-spam. The project is divided into four phases: Ideation, Design and Innovation, Development, and Model Training.

Dataset Source:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

Phase 1: Ideation Phase
Problem Statement: In this phase, we defined the problem statement, which is to develop a spam classifier.
Design Thinking: We brainstormed and conceptualized the project, considering design and innovation strategies.

Phase 2: Design and Innovation
In this phase, we outlined the design and innovation strategies that will be used to classify spam and non-spam messages.

Phase 3: Development (Part 1)
Google colab File:
    We created a Google colab notebook for data preprocessing and loading.
Data Exploration: 
    Explored and visualized the dataset.
Platform: 
    We ran the colab notebook in Google Colab.
Dependencies: 
    Imported necessary libraries.

Dataset:
    Loaded and explored the dataset.

Phase 4: Model Training 
Machine Learning Algorithm:
     We selected the Naive Bayes algorithm for model training.
Google colab File: 
     Created a new Google colab notebook for the model training.
Dependencies: 
     Imported relevant dependencies.
NLTK Resources:
     Downloaded and utilized NLTK resources for text preprocessing.
Training:
     Trained a Naive Bayes classifier.
Evaluation:
     Evaluated the classifier's performance.
Results: 
     Displayed the evaluation results in Google Colab.
GitHub: 
     Uploaded the project to GitHub for sharing and collaboration.

Running the Code:

To run this code, follow these steps:
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-spam-classifier.git
Open the project folder in your Google colab Notebook environment (e.g., Google Colab).

Navigate to the "Development" or "Model Training" phase in the Google colab notebook and execute the code cells step by step.

Make sure to install the required dependencies mentioned in the notebook using !pip install or !conda install.
Ensure that you have downloaded the necessary NLTK resources for text preprocessing.
Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can test it on new data for spam classification.
